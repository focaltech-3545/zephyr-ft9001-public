          An array of pins sharing the same group properties. The pins should
          be defined using pre-defined macros or, alternatively.
      slew-rate:
        type: string
        default: "max-speed-2mhz"
        enum:
          - "max-speed-10mhz"
          - "max-speed-2mhz"
          - "max-speed-50mhz"
          - "max-speed-highest"
        description: |
          Set the maximum speed of a pin. This setting effectively limits the
          slew rate of the output signal. Defaults to "max-speed-2mhz", the SoC
          default. The max-speed-highest option may not be available on all SoC
          variants. If selected and not available the 50 MHz maximum speed will
          be used instead. Note that usage of max-speed-highest may require
          enabling the I/O compensation cell (refer to the gd,gd32-afio binding
          for more details).
